    <div class="description">
      <p>Responsible for guiding the front end architecture along with mentoring junior developers. I regularly paired with engineers to assist in development, and could often be found drawing on a whiteboard to help explain difficult pieces of the system or how the team should move forward with a specific implementation. I worked with the operations team to build and deploy our applications in CI and in production, while also working alongside test teams to design our test strategy. Additionally, I worked with both the product and design teams to coordinate features and help explain development estimates.</p>
      <p>The legacy UI application had originally been developed using jQuery and Backbone, but was migrated to a React, Redux, Webpack front end. Node was used on the server side, and the legacy system utilized an older version of Express along with server side Jade rendered templates. The templates were removed in place of React views, Express was upgraded, and Node modules were introduced to share code across the applications.</p>

    <div class="description">
      <p>Led both the team and the development of the user interface for CognitiveScale. Responsible for hiring new front end engineers, along with mentoring and leading the front end team. Held daily standups and retrospectives which included the design team as well, as we tried to integrate the efforts of both front end and design. Responsible for working with the product and business teams to break down customer requirements into work items for the front end team.</p>
      <p>The UI was often web based, but some use cases required a native device application (iOS). The front end web technology was a mix of React, Redux, Webpack, and Babel, along with React Native in some experimental native development. Node.js was used to power the server side of the UI, utilizing Express for APIs and Mongo for storage. In earlier iterations, the front end used Angular, and in the native device case, a combination of Ionic and Angular.</p>
      <p>Assisted the developer operations team on deployment of the Node.js applications, as well as production support for CognitiveScale applications. Helped build documentation and training around the use of CognitiveScale for customer sessions.</p>

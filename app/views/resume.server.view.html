                <p>Designed and led in the development of the user interface for CognitiveScale.  The UI was often web based, but some use cases required a native device application (iOS).  The technology for the front end was initially Angular, and in the native device case, a combination of Ionic and Angular.  The front end web technology later shifted to use a mix of React, Redux, Webpack, and Babel.  Node.js was used to power the server side of the UI, utilizing Express for APIs and Mongo for storage.</p>
                <p>Responsible for hiring of new UI engineers, along with mentoring and leading the UI team.  Held daily standups and retrospectives which included the design team as well, as we tried to integrate the efforts of both front end and design.  Responsible for working with the product and business teams to break down customer requirements into work items for the UI team.</p>
                <p>Assisted the developer operations team on deployment of the Node.js applications, as well as production support for CognitiveScale applications.  Helped build documentation and training around the use of CognitiveScale for customer sessions.</p>
